# Heart-Disease-Prediction
This project focuses on developing a heart disease risk prediction model using machine learning algorithms. Key algorithms implemented include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and K-Nearest Neighbors. The dataset was preprocessed and hyperparameters were tuned using GridSearchCV to enhance model performance. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, cross-validation score, and ROC AUC score were used to assess the models. The Random Forest classifier achieved the highest cross-validation score at 92.91%. The project aims to provide an accurate, data-driven tool for early detection of heart disease.
